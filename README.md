# Select

> Draw select boxes with your mouse (in a browser).

The default style is based on Mac OSX. It fades out as well.

Currently it just draws a pretty box to the screen.

## Todo

- Add CSS vendor prefixes
- Package JS as a plugin
- Allow users to set the fadeout time
- Actually select elements
